title: Clawject IoC Container
---

An IoC container is a common characteristic of frameworks that implement IoC.

In Clawject, class defined with **`@ClawjectApplication`** decorator is a representation of the single IoC container.
The Clawject container is responsible for instantiating, configuring and assembling objects known as Beans,
as well as managing their life cycles.

Right now Clawject provides one way to manage IoC containers. **`ClawjectFactory`** class.

Here is the way to initialize the container:

```ts
import { ClawjectApplication, ClawjectFactory } from '@clawject/di';

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {}

const applicationContext = await ClawjectFactory.createApplicationContext(Application)
```

## Constructor-Based Dependency Injection

In the case of constructor-based dependency injection,
the container will invoke a constructor with arguments each representing a dependency we want to set.

Clawject resolves each argument primarily by type, followed by the name of the constructor parameter.
Let's see the defining of a bean and its dependencies using Bean function call:

```ts
class Bar {}
class Foo {
  constructor(private bar: Bar) {}
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  foo = Bean(Foo)
  bar = Bean(Bar)
}
```

We're passing class constructor to the Bean function and assigning the result of function to the class property to define a bean;
Bean name is a class property name to which we assign the result of the Bean function.

## Bean scopes

You can read more about scopes more here [@Scope](/docs/api/scope.mdx).

For a bean with the default **singleton scope**,
Clawject first checks if instance of the bean already created,
and only creates a new one if it doesn't.
If we're using the **transient scope**, the container returns a new bean instance for each bean request.

Let's see how we can define a bean with the **transient** scope.
We have two beans that require the **Baz** instance,
for each of which the container creates a new instance of a **Baz** class.

```ts
class Baz {}
class Bar {
  constructor(private baz: Baz) {}
}
class Foo {
  constructor(private baz: Baz) {}
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  foo = Bean(Foo)
  bar = Bean(Bar)

  @Scope('transient')
  baz = Bean(Baz)
}
```

## Lazy Initialized Beans

You can read more about lazy beans here [@Lazy](/docs/api/lazy.mdx).

By default, the container creates and configures all singleton beans during initialization.
To avoid this, we can use the **lazy** decorator with on the bean configuration level:

**foo** bean will only be initialized when it's first requested, and not at startup.

```ts
class Foo {}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Lazy
  foo = Bean(Foo)
}
```
