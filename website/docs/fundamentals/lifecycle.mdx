## Lifecycle

Clawject allows us to attach custom actions to bean or application creation and destruction,
and it is done using the `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` decorators.

`@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` can be used in `@Configuration`, `@ClawjectApplication` classes and in Beans.
You can decorate `method` or `property with arrow function`, also decoration target should not be `static`.

`@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` can be used together at the same method — so the method will be called twice.

Note that `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` works a little different in configuration classes and in Beans,
when using in configuration classes - you can pass arguments to the method,
these arguments will be treated as a dependencies, and container will inject appropriate Beans to the method, in other hand,
when using in Bean - you can't pass arguments to the method,
container will not inject anything to the method and will report compilation error.

### @PostConstruct

Clawject calls the methods annotated with @PostConstruct only once, just after the initialization of bean or application.

#### @PostConstruct in Context

Let's use the `@PostConstruct` decorator in the `@Configuration` class:

```ts
@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Bean foo = 'string';

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(stringBean: string) { // <- "foo" bean will be injected here
    console.log(`MyContext has been created, "stringBean" value is ${stringBean}`);
  }
}
```

#### @PostConstruct in Bean

Let's use the `@PostConstruct` decorator in the Bean:

```ts
class Foo {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Foo bean has been created');
  }
}
```

Now when we register this class as a Bean in context -
the `postConstruct` method will be called when `Foo` instance is created.

### @PreDestroy

Clawject calls the methods annotated with @PreDestroy only once,
just before context clearing or bean removal from context.

The purpose of this method should be to release resources or perform other cleanup tasks,
such as closing a database connection, before the bean gets destroyed.

#### @PreDestroy in Context

Let's use the `@PreDestroy` decorator in the Context:

```ts
@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Bean foo = 'string';

  @PreDestroy
  preDestroy(stringBean: string) { // <- "foo" bean will be injected here
    console.log(`MyContext is going to be destroyed, "stringBean" value is ${stringBean}`);
  }
}
```

#### @PreDestroy in Bean

Let's use the `@PreDestroy` decorator in the Bean:

```ts
class Foo {
  @PreDestroy
  preDestroy() {
    console.log('Foo bean is going to be destroyed');
  }
}
```

Now when we register this class as a Bean in context -
the `preDestroy` method will be called when `Foo` bean is going to be destroyed.
